char has 1 byte or 8 bits. 1 bit for sign and can represent 2^7 = -127 to 127;
int(short) has 2 bytes or 16 bits. 1 bit for sign and can represent 2^15 = -32,767 to 32,767;
int(long) has 32 bits or 4 bytes (more common). 1 bit for positive or negative sign, being 2^31 = 2,147,483,648;
float has 32 bits and can represent 3.4x10^-38 or 3.4x10^38 significant digits after the decimal point;
double has 64 bits with 1 for negative or positive sign being 2^63 = 1.7x10^-308 or 1.7x10^308.
char stores only 1 character, however, we can specify how many characters it should store with char name[30];

In C, there are 2 ways to declare a variable, through define and const:
  > define is used to create symbolic constants during the preprocessing phase. It simply replaces the constant name with its value throughout the code.
  > const is used to create constants during compilation. You declare a variable with const and assign a value to it, and this value cannot be changed during program execution.
